## 👩‍💻 About Me

🔢 **Numbers Tell Stories — I Build the Narrators**  
I’m energized by open-ended problems. Whether it’s optimizing models, designing user flows, or automating logic, I enjoy breaking things down and solving them creatively.

I'm always driven by **purpose-led development**. I love taking on complex challenges and simplifying them into real-world, usable solutions especially using AI/ML, data, and thoughtful UI/UX.

Whether it's decoding patterns in analytical data or optimizing digital workflows, I believe in making tech that matters.
